# UFOs
Module 12 Work and Challenge Assignment.
Coding Language: JavaScript

1.	Overview of Project:
This project was intended to create a webpage that would allow visitors to filter through a data set of UFO sightings based on numerous different criteria. The page allows for filtering on date, the locations within city, state, and country, and finally to search on the shape of the UFO itself.

Users can search based on any of these five factors at a time as they pursue their interests in UFOs.

2.	Results: 
The webpage search functions support user inputs and show examples for the formatting for entering the date, state and country abbreviations. 

Once there has been information entered into any of these text boxes the user needs to only press enter on their keyboard in order to finalize the search and generate results.

3.	Potential for further development:
One drawback which could be improved on in further version of this website would be to generate a message that tells a user there is no information if their search criteria has nothing to display.

A recommendation to improve on this would be to create a distance or range feature. This could center on a city but give the user an option to search for all data within a specific distance from that city. These defined areas will help for individuals who do not live within urban centers to see how prevalent these sightings are in rural areas.

A second recommendation would be to create dropdown menus instead of text entry. That way users can scan the list to see if there are locations of interest with data.
